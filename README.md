# stat_rethink
Code for explained examples/figures/exercises in the book 'Statistical Rethinking' by Richard McElreath 2nd Ed.

Also contains similar examples done using popular dataasets available in R packages eg. mtcars,lung and other datasets present in other books.
I am not a statistician or data analyst. I am a clinical outcomes researcher with a passion and strong interest for data science, statistics and desire to learn bayesian inference.
